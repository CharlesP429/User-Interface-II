    <h2>Charles Peck</h2>

    <section class="about">
        <p1>I am a starting Web Developer, currently going to school to learn how to create these websites such as this one. It is tough but I love to learn new practices, especially those that will help better my future in this technologically advanced world.</p1>

        <p2>Honestly, this is my third time through the courses, and I should have taken my time more seriously. The second time through, I didn't care about doing the projects again. I just sat at my computer and thought that because I've been here before, I didn't need to listen. Boy was I wrong. Since then, I have followed along with the classes and listened to the teacher, who goes over things I never did before.</p2>
